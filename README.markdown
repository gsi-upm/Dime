==================================

Introduction
---------------------

**Dime** is an open source **domain specific language** (DSL) created in order to develop
voice apps in an easy way. It provides an eclipse plugin that is able to generate code in different
voice languages such as **Tropo**, **VoiceXML** or **Twilio**, in combination with other scripting languages
such as Php, JavaScript or Python.

It is a state oriented language. Voices apps are modelled as state machines, which is a common practice in this field.

Dime is part of the R&D  **TelcoDev** project (TSI-020100-2010-1092) funded by the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism.
